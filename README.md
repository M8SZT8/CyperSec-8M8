# Whoami

Welcome to my corner of the digital realm! I’m Mosad Sallam, a passionate and results-driven Cybersecurity Professional with a focus on penetration testing and bug bounty hunting. Over the past year, I’ve honed my skills in web application and API security testing, earning recognition from esteemed organizations like NASA, NPS, Baidu, Monash University, and Adjust Company for my contributions in identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.

As a Bug Hunter on platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd, I’ve delved into the intricacies of web applications and APIs, collaborating closely with development teams to ensure swift and effective resolutions. My journey has led to achievements like reaching P1 Warrior, earning the Submission Shogan title, and being acknowledged for discovering over 50 security bugs.

In the realm of technical skills, I wield the power of automation through Python and bash scripting, conduct web/API pentesting following OWASP Top 10 guidelines, and operate at an OSCP-level in network pentesting. I’m not just about code and exploits; I’m a creator too. You can find my projects on GitHub, including tools like AutoSubRecon, Sec\_Mind\_Maps, Recon88r, SubMonit88r, and a collection of nuclei templates.

Balancing technical prowess with soft skills, I bring effective time management and collaborative team spirit to every project. A perpetual learner, I’m committed to constant development and growth.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer and Control Engineering Systems, I aim to push the boundaries of cybersecurity, armed with certifications from APIsec University, TCM Security, The SecOps Group, MaharaTech ITI Learning Platform, and expertise in OWASP Top 10 for both web and API security.

Join me on this exciting journey as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, sharing insights, tools, and discoveries on my blog. Let’s fortify the digital world together!
