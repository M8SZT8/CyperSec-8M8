# Mass Assignment VS BFLA VS BOLA
"Mass Assignment," "BFLA" (Broken Function Level Authorization), and "BOLA" (Broken Object Level Authorization) are all terms related to web application security, specifically dealing with authorization and access control vulnerabilities. Let's define each of these terms:

1. **Mass Assignment**:
   - **Definition**: Mass Assignment is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can manipulate the parameters of a request to modify data fields that they should not have access to.
   - **Typical Scenario**: It often occurs in web applications when developers expose object properties as request parameters without proper validation or authorization checks, allowing attackers to update sensitive fields, such as user roles or permissions.

2. **BFLA (Broken Function Level Authorization)**:
   - **Definition**: BFLA refers to a situation where an application allows users to access certain functions or actions without proper authorization or checks.
   - **Typical Scenario**: This vulnerability arises when an application does not verify the user's authorization level correctly before executing a particular function. It can result in unauthorized access to functionality or data that should be restricted.

3. **BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)**:
   - **Definition**: BOLA is a security issue where an attacker can manipulate parameters or data to access or modify objects (such as files, database records, or resources) without proper authorization.
   - **Typical Scenario**: BOLA vulnerabilities occur when an application does not adequately check whether a user has permission to access or modify a specific object. Attackers exploit this to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

In summary, while Mass Assignment, BFLA, and BOLA all relate to authorization and access control vulnerabilities, they refer to different aspects of these issues. Mass Assignment deals with improper data manipulation, BFLA focuses on function-level access, and BOLA pertains to object-level access. Web application developers and security professionals need to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security of their applications.
