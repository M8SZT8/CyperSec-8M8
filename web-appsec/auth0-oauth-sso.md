# Auth0, OAuth, SSO

### OAuth

**Definition**:

* OAuth (Open Authorization) is a protocol that allows third-party services to exchange user information without exposing credentials. It grants limited access to user resources on another service.

**Use Cases**:

* Allowing an application to access user data from another service (e.g., a calendar app accessing Google Calendar).
* Enabling secure delegated access to user resources (e.g., allowing a social media app to post on behalf of a user).

**Key Components**:

* **Resource Owner**: The user who owns the data.
* **Client**: The application requesting access.
* **Resource Server**: The server holding the user's data (e.g., Google's servers).
* **Authorization Server**: Issues tokens to the client after authenticating the user (e.g., Google's OAuth server).
* **Access Token**: A token provided to the client to access the resource server.

**Flow Example**:

1. The user logs into an application (client).
2. The application redirects the user to the OAuth provider's authorization server.
3. The user grants permission to the application.
4. The authorization server redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code.
5. The application exchanges the code for an access token.
6. The application uses the token to access the user's data on the resource server.

#### SSO (Single Sign-On)

**Definition**:

* SSO is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials.

**Use Cases**:

* Enterprise environments where users need access to multiple internal systems and applications.
* Websites offering multiple services under the same umbrella (e.g., Google services like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Drive).

**Key Components**:

* **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Authenticates the user and provides tokens/assertions (e.g., SAML assertions).
* **Service Provider (SP)**: Relies on the IdP to authenticate users.
* **Token/Assertion**: Information provided by the IdP that confirms the user's identity.

**Flow Example**:

1. The user attempts to access an application (service provider).
2. The service provider redirects the user to the identity provider.
3. The user authenticates with the identity provider.
4. The identity provider returns a token/assertion to the service provider.
5. The service provider grants access to the user based on the token/assertion.

#### Auth0

**Definition**:

* Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to applications. It supports multiple authentication methods, including OAuth, SSO, and custom integrations.

**Use Cases**:

* Quickly implementing authentication in applications without building the infrastructure from scratch.
* Managing user authentication and authorization across multiple applications and services.
* Providing a unified login experience across various platforms (web, mobile, IoT).

**Key Features**:

* **Identity Management**: User authentication, password management, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* **Social Login**: Integration with social identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
* **Enterprise Integration**: Integration with enterprise identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory).
* **Custom Authentication**: Custom rules, hooks, and actions for advanced use cases.
* **Security**: Built-in security features such as anomaly detection, brute force protection, and breached password detection.

**How It Relates to OAuth and SSO**:

* **OAuth Integration**: Auth0 can act as an OAuth authorization server, allowing third-party applications to request access to user data.
* **SSO Support**: Auth0 supports SSO, enabling users to log in once and access multiple applications and services seamlessly.
* **Additional Services**: Beyond OAuth and SSO, Auth0 offers extensive authentication and authorization features, including user management and advanced security measures.

#### Comparison

1. **Purpose**:
   * **OAuth**: Standardized protocol for delegated access to user resources.
   * **SSO**: Unified login system to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
   * **Auth0**: Comprehensive authentication and authorization platform offering OAuth, SSO, and more.
2. **Scope**:
   * **OAuth**: Focused on granting limited access to user data across services.
   * **SSO**: Focused on simplifying user login across multiple applications.
   * **Auth0**: Broad scope covering various authentication and authorization needs.
3. **Components**:
   * **OAuth**: Resource Owner, Client, Resource Server, Authorization Server, Access Token.
   * **SSO**: Identity Provider, Service Provider, Token/Assertion.
   * **Auth0**: Identity Management, Social Login, Enterprise Integration, Custom Authentication, Security.

#### Summary

* **OAuth** is a protocol for delegated access to user data.
* **SSO** is an authentication process that allows access to multiple applications with one set of credentials.
* **Auth0** is a platform providing a range of authentication and authorization services, including OAuth and SSO.

Each serves a distinct purpose but can be interconnected, with Auth0 providing a comprehensive solution that incorporates both OAuth and SSO functionalities along with additional features.
