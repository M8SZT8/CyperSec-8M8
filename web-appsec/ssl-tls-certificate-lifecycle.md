# SSL/TLS Certificate Lifecycle

## **Understanding the SSL/TLS Certificate Lifecycle**

SSL/TLS certificates are crucial for secure online communication. They are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) and verify the identity of websites and servers. Each certificate has a lifecycle, starting with a request and ending with expiration or revocation.

## Stages

**1. Request and Enrollment**

* A user requests a certificate by submitting a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
* The CSR contains information about the domain name or organization.
* The CA validates the request and issues the certificate.

**2. Issuance and Provisioning**

* The CA digitally signs the certificate, confirming its authenticity.
* The certificate is installed on the website or server.

**3. Usage and Monitoring**

* The certificate is used for secure communication.
* Monitoring systems track certificate usage and status.
* Timely renewal or revocation is ensured.

**4. Expiration and Renewal**

* Certificates expire after a certain period.
* Renewal is necessary to avoid interruptions.
* The certificate holder or CA initiates the renewal process.
* A new certificate is issued with a digital stamp.

**Effective certificate management is essential for maintaining secure online operations.**
