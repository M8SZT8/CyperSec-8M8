- _==Introduction To Post-Exploitation==_

> _==Post-exploitation==_ is the final phase of the penetration testing process and consist of the tactics , techniques and procedures that attackers/adversaries undertake after obtaining initial access on a target system

> In other words , post-exploitation involves what you do or have to do once u gain access to the target system .

> Post-exploitation will differ based on the target operating system as well as the target infrastructure .

    - `ps` â‡’ will list all process on the system
    - `pgrep < process name >` â‡’ will return with the process id , which we will use to migrate it to another ( recommended using explorer.exe , if u want a stable metepreter session migrate a explorer.exe )
    - `migrate <process id >` â‡’ that will migrate the process , so now metepreter session will work with new process , and if we migrate a 64-bit process , the metepreter session will be a 64-bit .
    - `shell` && `net start` â‡’ that will list all background services running
    - `wmic service list brief` â‡’ itâ€™s same as net start
    - `tasklist /SVC` â‡’ that will list all services running under the process and process , one of the important command
