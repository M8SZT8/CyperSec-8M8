- ==**_MSF_**==

> Is process of scanning target for Vulnerability

  

- _**==Vulnerability Scanning==**_
    
    - `nmap -sn <ip>` ⇒ to see what hosts are up
    - `msfconsole` && `setg Rhost <your ip>`
    - `now the first step is to know the version of target u want to search attack for it`
    - `db_nmap -sV -sS -o <ip>` ⇒ To figer out what services running and the version of it && ==save all result on msfconsole==
    - `hosts` ⇒ to see the host that belong to nmap scan && `services` ⇒ to see the result of port scan and services
    - now after we see the services running , we want to identify the Vulnerability related to this target ⇒ `copy the name of service` && `search type:exploit name <full name and version of service u want>`
    - `searchsploit “<service u want to search about it>”` ⇒ that will search for exploit in ==Exploitdb== and ==metasploit== …etc
    
    > ==metasploit-autopwn== : it’s a metasploit plugin for easy exploit and vulnerability attack (==GitHub==)
    
    - after install it && `mv db_autopwn.rb /usr/share/metasploit-fr…/plugins/` && in msfconsole ⇒ `load db_autopwn` && `db_autopwn`
    
    > see the doc of the tool to know how to do what u want
    
    - `analyze` && `vulns` ⇒ analyze based on hosts and services it will list all exploit can be done and save it on vulns .
    
      
    
      
    

  

  

- ==_**Nessus**_==

> Is proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by tenable

> download Nessus on kali (essentials version /free ) , the binary file && `chmod +x <name of binary >` && `sudo dpkg -i <name of backage>` && `sudo systemctl start <nessus service >` && enter the url for it in browser and go , enter the activation code and enter the username and password admin:<password>

- ==_**Nessus**_==
    
    - after install it , from the right corner , click on `new scan`
    - under the network templet , select basic network scan
    - fill out all info on discovery , assessment , reporting ,advanced
    - save it , and on dashboard , click on launch on the right
    - now we want export it to Metasploit ⇒ ==**_click on export and save file_**== && on Msfconsole ⇒ `db_import </location of nessus file >` && `vulns`
    - now see all result and take a look for CVE copy the year && `search cve:<year of cve> name:<protocol>`
    
      
    

  

  

- ==_**Web Apps**_==

> ==_**WMAP**_== ⇒ is a powerful feature-rich web application vulnerability scanner , used to automate web server enumeration and scan for vulnerabilities

- ==_**Web Apps**_==
    
    - on msfconsole ⇒ `load wmap`
    - `wmap_sites -a <target ip>` ⇒ to add the ip to the sites list
    - `wmap_target -t http://<target ip>/` ⇒ to add the http port of our target to the target list
    - `wmap_sites -l` ⇒ to see available sites
    - `wmap_run -t` ⇒ to display all auxiliary modules related to target we set it
    - `wmap_run -e` ⇒ that will let wmap to run all result from the -t , and bommm :)
    - `wmap_vulns -l` ⇒ to list all vuln that discovered in wmap_run
